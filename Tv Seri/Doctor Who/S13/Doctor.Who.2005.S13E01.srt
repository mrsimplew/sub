1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,560
<i>Listen to me,
Karvanista. </i>

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,640
<i>If you think you have won
this little skirmish, </i>

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,840
<i>you are very much mistaken.</i>

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,200
Do not imagine for a second

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,760
that you have got
the better of us.
Right, Yaz?

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,200
Oh, yeah.
We are totally in command.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,840
<i>Is that right?
'Cause from where I'm hovering, </i>

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,840
<i>you seem to be
handcuffed and footlocked
to a gravity bar,  </i>

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,880
<i>which in 79 seconds
will release you </i>

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,120
<i>into the boiling acid ocean
directly below </i>

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,720
<i>where your bodies
will instantly disintegrate. </i>

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,160
<i>Even if you survive that,
which you won't,
in four minutes' time,  </i>

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,480
<i>the entire planet
will be engulfed
by a nearby giant red star.  </i>

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,360
<i>Oh, and if you try to escape,
my Kill Disks will blast you
to pieces.  </i>

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
<i>Meanwhile, I am now far away,</i>

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,880
<i>travelling towards
what will in future be known </i>

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,440
<i>as the final hours
of planet Earth. </i>

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,680
What?

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,400
<i>Don't worry.
You'll be long dead. </i>

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,960
I must admit, Yaz,

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,040
I can't help feeling
that some of this is my fault.

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,040
Some?

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,080
- All of this is your fault.
- What do you mean?

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,040
Accidentally blowing up
Karvanista's droid guards

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,560
when we were trying to
sneak into his operations
base unnoticed?

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,560
It's very temperamental,
Nitro-9.

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,520
Suggesting we escape his base
by air-surfing on this gravbar?

28
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,560
How was I to know
the force shield would reboot

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,360
at the exact moment we were
heading towards it?

30
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,520
And when we got captured,
you had to mention

31
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,360
the two sets of cuffs
in your pocket.

32
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,880
Two words, Yaz.
Trapezium Seven.

33
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,440
- Okay.
- Trapezium Seven.

34
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,640
That high-gravity
circus workshop.

35
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,520
Who were the top two
in the class?

36
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,640
- Ready?
- No!

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,440
Me neither.
I love being not ready.

38
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,920
Three. Two. One.

39
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,000
Alley-oop!

40
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,680
- Got it!

41
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Time to go.

42
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,920
How do we get these cuffs off?

43
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,520
Very easily.
Because, Yasmin Khan,

44
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,880
they're voice activated!

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,040
And that's why I told him
they were in my pocket!

46
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,560
Release.

47
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,920
- Release!
- Release!

48
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,040
Release!
Or maybe I was Scottish
when I set them up.

49
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,320
Release.

50
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,480
Release!

51
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,480
Doctor!

52
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,240
Doctor, the gravbar's breaking.

53
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,480
That's inconvenient!

54
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,600
Release. Release. Release!

55
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,320
Maybe it's my tone of voice.

56
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
It's there!

57
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,200
- Call it!
- Now!

58
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,360
What a relief.

59
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,840
Right. No one gets away
with doing that to us, Yaz.

60
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,800
What was it he said?

61
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,520
Final few hours of planet Earth?

62
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,480
He doesn't get rid of us
that easily.

63
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,880
Not enough.

64
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,360
That is not enough.

65
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,400
We need more workers.

66
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,040
Returned soldiers, the poor,

67
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,560
they must all be brought here
and put to work.

68
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,240
Ah. There's still far to go.

69
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,000
Of course, sir.
May I also remind you,

70
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,040
Mr Stonehouse is due shortly.

71
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,560
<i>Williamson,
for the love of God,
what are you doing here?  </i>

72
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,720
Why all this digging?

73
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,120
I provide work and wages

74
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,400
for those who would
not otherwise find it.

75
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,480
Is that not enough?

76
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,160
Of course, it is laudable.

77
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,800
But do you not think about
what you are creating?

78
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,720
I think very deeply about it.

79
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,360
More deeply than
you can possibly know.

80
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,960
Then why can I see
no rational plan at work here?

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,440
The designs are eccentric.
The work is random.

82
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,160
And as for the tunnels
being excavated,

83
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,000
they are without purpose.

84
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,240
Without purpose?

85
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,920
If I were to speak to you
about their true purpose,

86
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,360
your mind would buckle
under the pressure.

87
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,000
With respect, sir,

88
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,920
of the two of us,

89
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,880
my mind is clearly
the more robust and rational.

90
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,160
You imagine what lies ahead

91
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,240
can be defeated with rationale?

92
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,320
And pray, Mr Williamson,

93
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,000
what do you imagine
to lie ahead of us?

94
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,040
The cataclysmic.

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,200
The impossible.

96
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,640
<i>Doesn't matter
where you go in the world, </i>

97
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,760
<i>it could be
the greatest museums
in the biggest cities,  </i>

98
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,280
<i>none of them have got
what we've got, right here. </i>

99
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,160
Nobody has got a top floor
like the Museum of Liverpool.

100
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,320
'Cause nobody
has got our history.

101
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,520
Over there,
we've got the writers.

102
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,640
Over there, the musicians.
And over there, the footballers.

103
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,560
These are massive.

104
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,400
They're the pinnacle
of this building,

105
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,880
and this city.

106
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,760
These define us.

107
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,400
These make Liverpool.

108
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,120
Dan. Dan!

109
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,680
That's enough from me now.

110
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,240
I'll let you have
a look around on your own.

111
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,000
All right, Di.

112
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,520
How many times?
Dan, you've got to stop.

113
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,800
You don't work here.
You're not a guide.

114
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,520
Stop pretending to be official.

115
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,640
I am official. Official Scouse.

116
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,880
Just think of me
as a free exhibit.

117
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,760
Just a little bit livelier
than the others.

118
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,680
Lad, you've got a trade.
Do that.

119
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,600
I know, but I'm good at this.

120
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,120
And I'm only chatting.
I make your punters happy.

121
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,200
What's the point of being
alive if it's not to make
others happy?

122
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,520
Alan says, if you do it again,
he'll ban you permanently.

123
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,600
- What if we say just mornings?
- No.

124
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,440
So, we still on
for Halloween drinks tonight?

125
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,840
Yeah, yeah.

126
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,600
Unless you've changed your mind.

127
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,800
No. No, I haven't.

128
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,480
No. Good. Me neither.

129
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,960
Eight o'clock,
the corner of Lark Lane.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,200
- It's a date.
- Yeah.

131
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,440
- Not a date date
I'm not presuming.
- No. Yeah.

132
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,120
- Yeah.
- But... Yeah, okay.

133
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,640
I've got to go.

134
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,080
And don't keep me waiting, you,
the Late Dan Lewis.

135
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
Not tonight.

136
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
Go on.

137
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,080
That's the fourth time.

138
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,880
I know.
This is the simplest trajectory,
Earth.

139
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,560
We should be there already.
What's wrong with you?

140
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,880
<i>Psychic connection
reactivating, Doctor. </i>

141
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,840
Who's that?
How am I seeing this?

142
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,480
<i>Just watch.</i>

143
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,920
Still alive.

144
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,480
After all this time.

145
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,400
How long has it been here?

146
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,120
Imprisoned since
the dawn of the universe.

147
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,000
That's what I was told.
People embellish though.

148
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,120
Our job is to ensure
all incarceration systems

149
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,440
are still functional,
and get the hell out.

150
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,720
Evaluation report
on prisoner Swarm.

151
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,400
Confinement location,

152
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,240
remnants of
The Burnished Rage battleground.

153
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,040
Incarceration systems
remain active.

154
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,160
Approaching prisoner
for distanced live check.

155
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,280
Do not engage
with the prisoner
in conversation.

156
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,320
Do not do anything that it asks,

157
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,480
no matter what it asks
or how persuasive it seems.

158
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,680
I mean, obviously.
I have done
my psych-resistance training.

159
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,400
Containment chamber active.

160
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,360
Physical securings
still in place.

161
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,160
Stratospheric impoundment
systems operative.

162
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,320
Prisoner remains secure.

163
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,200
Your last tour, En Sentac.

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,680
How does it know that?

165
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,520
How many times
across the millennia have you
stared at me in silence?

166
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,120
Now you're handing over
your task...

167
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,320
to a child.

168
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,440
The kid will do fine.

169
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,480
You're as confined
as you always have been,

170
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,000
and always will be.

171
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,200
Wrong.

172
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,200
Containment chamber malfunction.

173
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,800
- Boss?
-Feeling paralysed?

174
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,000
Proof that your life's work
has ended...

175
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,560
in failure.

176
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,200
Your reward

177
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,920
for admirable service,
to Division.

178
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,480
Renewed at last!

179
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,680
What have you done?

180
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,000
I waited.

181
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,360
I planned.

182
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,720
And now, I'm going to execute.

183
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,000
That won't work, child.

184
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,720
Your time is over.

185
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,040
As mine...

186
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,480
has begun once more.

187
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,480
Huh.

188
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,800
Trick or treat, Doctor.

189
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,480
Doctor! Doctor!

190
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,880
Have you seen this?

191
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,480
It's like the TARDIS is leaking.

192
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,480
Do you know what it is?

193
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,120
Nothing to worry about.
It's fine.

194
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,320
I'm fine, TARDIS is fine.
We're all fine.

195
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,760
We'll be on Earth any moment.

196
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
Right. Dateline.

197
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
October 31st.

198
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,920
Halloween. Trick or treat.

199
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,080
Yeah, that'll see you
right for a bit.

200
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,640
- Thanks.
-Oh, hang on.

201
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,160
Take a couple of them
for tonight,

202
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,800
as long as you promise
not to haunt me.

203
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,120
- Look after yourselves, ta-ra.
- Come on.

204
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,560
Yeah. Will I make up
a box for you?

205
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,080
No, I'm sound, thanks.

206
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,000
Well, at least take some soup.
Hmm?

207
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,920
Wilma, who likes soup?
Really.

208
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,920
Don't be proud, Daniel,
come on.

209
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,240
There's plenty of people
who need soup
a lot more than me.

210
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,160
And anyway, my numbers
are coming up on Wednesday.

211
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,800
You don't even play the lottery.

212
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,400
I know, that's how lucky I am.

213
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,080
- Wait.

214
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
Did you see that?

215
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,600
What?

216
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,760
There's something out there.

217
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,800
You've been
on the sherry early tonight.
Come on.

218
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
Let's lock up.

219
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,200
Trick or treat.

220
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,400
Oh.
You scared me there.

221
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,200
Yeah. You can have
the last ones.

222
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,440
You look great.

223
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,240
Go on, go home safe now.

224
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
Night night.

225
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,040
All right, la.

226
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,000
Trick or treat.

227
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,600
No.

228
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,600
- You what?
- How old are you?

229
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,920
- What's the difference?
- You're not even dressed up.

230
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,640
- Yeah, well, neither are you.
- You're just going round

231
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,840
knocking on people's doors.

232
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,720
I heard you had sweets.

233
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,320
Go on. Get off with youse.

234
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,760
Don't be throwing eggs
at my house.

235
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,800
Take the soup, will you?

236
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,720
Yes.
Gaze upon my might.

237
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,040
What is it with you lot tonight?

238
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,520
Kneel before the might
of the Lupari.

239
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,160
You're paying for that door,
you know.

240
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,840
Be silent!

241
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,640
Or face execution
at the hands of Karvanista.

242
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,240
Vanquisher of
the Thousand Civilisations.

243
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,840
Submit or die.

244
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,480
Well, you've
definitely put the effort in.

245
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,880
You will not resist.
You will do exactly
as I command.

246
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,960
Don't think I will.

247
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,240
I said, you will not resist.
You'll do exactly as I command.

248
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,040
And I said,
get back out through that door.

249
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,280
Or I'm getting the bizzies.

250
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,200
- Why's that not working?

251
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,600
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me?

252
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,920
I'm not the one going around
smashing into people's houses

253
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
dressed as a dog.

254
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,520
What did you just call me?

255
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,400
I mean it's good, like it's...

256
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,160
it's cute.

257
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
It looks dead soft.

258
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,800
Is it real fur?

259
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,520
You defile the sacred legacy
of my forebears!

260
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,280
You don't look
anything like four bears.

261
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
Go on, shoo.
Get back to your mam.

262
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,680
Tell her what
a brave lad you've been.

263
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,880
Never talk of my mother.

264
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,080
Liverpool.

265
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,560
Anfield.

266
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,760
Klopp era. Classic.

267
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,600
Oh, Yaz,
maybe we could take in a game,

268
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,160
I've seen the Barcelona match
nine times.

269
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,520
I was a ball boy
for Trent, once.

270
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,080
Hmm.

271
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,800
Number 37.

272
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,600
Non-terrestrial weapon
dispersal traces.

273
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,680
And a door that's left open.

274
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,000
Anyone home?

275
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,840
I'm guessing, single bloke,
definitely a Red.

276
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,720
Someone's made
a right mess in here.

277
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,240
Ugh. Stun cube. Lupari tech.
Karvanista was here.

278
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,640
Looks like he took
whoever lived here.

279
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,760
Why would he do that?

280
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,080
Daniel Lewis.

281
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,560
- This could be him.
- So where is he now?

282
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,400
Ah. Quick check
of planetary orbit.

283
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,800
Nice laptop, Dan.

284
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,080
Right.

285
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,840
There. 7.2 minutes ago,

286
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,600
Karvanista's ship,
leaving Earth,

287
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,960
shielded against detection.

288
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,920
- We're just behind him.
- So where's he going?

289
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,920
Why am I getting
multiple traces?

290
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,280
Hang on while I zoom out.

291
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,520
Seven billion Lupari ships
coming this way.

292
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,640
That's an invasion fleet, right?

293
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,560
It looks like it.

294
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,760
Karvanista's species,
all heading here.

295
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,560
Why was he ahead of them?

296
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,160
And why take the bloke
that lives here?

297
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,240
Also, one other thing
that's bugging me, tiny detail.

298
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,120
Why does Dan have
such a flashy computer?

299
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,280
Because it's not his.

300
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,440
Get out!

301
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,440
- Oops.

302
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,400
- Ah. Sorry.
- Sorry.

303
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,640
Hey, what have you done
with the chilies?

304
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,920
Mmm. Have you tried the fridge?

305
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,520
Why would they be
in the fridge?

306
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,000
- Well, sometimes you
put them in the fridge.
- I do not.

307
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,200
They're in the fridge.

308
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,920
Amazing.

309
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,000
What do we do?

310
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,200
I don't know.

311
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,200
Can we ignore it?

312
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,240
They promised this
would never happen.

313
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,240
Except in the gravest
of emergencies.

314
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,120
We didn't receive the warning.

315
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,000
Come on.

316
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
Let's eat.

317
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,080
A dog shot me.

318
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,320
How can a dog shoot me? Ow!

319
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,480
The bars on that holding pen
are electrified.

320
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,840
What am I doing in here?

321
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,760
Hang on. Holding pen?

322
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,680
- I'm not an animal.
- No.

323
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,280
Animals know when to be silent.

324
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,760
You wait till I get out of here.

325
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,920
- Why, what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna report you.

326
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,640
To who?

327
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,960
I'm gonna report you
for kidnapping,
what do you think of that?

328
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,440
Well, that's what's happening.
So, fine.

329
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
What?

330
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,480
You're mine.

331
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,280
- And I'm taking you off-world.
- What do you mean, off-world?

332
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,880
That's space.

333
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,520
And they say
you're a low-IQ species.

334
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,360
Well done.

335
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:39,000
We're travelling
away from your planet,
through space, on my spaceship.

336
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,280
Oh. Look at your little brain
trying to work it all out.

337
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,320
Embarrassing.

338
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,120
Why, though?

339
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,760
Why are you doing this?
What's so special about me?

340
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,400
Nothing.
There's nothing
special about you.

341
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,560
You're insignificant,
irrelevant,
and utterly meaningless.

342
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,680
You've gone to a lot of trouble

343
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,280
to kidnap someone
who's completely irrelevant.

344
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,200
Or maybe I should
just kill you!
Yeah?

345
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,800
I could, right here.

346
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,440
Yeah, but you haven't though,
have you?

347
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,360
No, you're not going to kill me.
You could've done that
in my kitchen.

348
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,560
If you've gone to all
this trouble to kidnap me,

349
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,120
killing me wouldn't make sense.

350
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,360
Oh, I'm done talking to you.

351
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,760
I'm right, though, aren't I?

352
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,920
Go on. Off you go.

353
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,600
Hang on. Come back!

354
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,440
Where are we actually going?

355
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,880
Compressor blast.
Tripped by the sonic.

356
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,520
He's deliberately leaving traps,
in case he's followed.

357
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,880
Clever, and dangerous,
our Karvanista.

358
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,720
So why are you obsessed
with following him?

359
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
I don't know
what you're talking about.

360
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,160
"I need to see
a man about a dog."
That's all you said.

361
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,520
But it turns out
the man is a dog,
and he's called Karvanista,

362
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,800
and you won't tell me why
you're so interested in him.

363
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,520
-Oh, my God.

364
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,480
- Doctor!
- Who's that?

365
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,720
I have no idea.

366
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,520
Erm, I didn't expect
to see you here.
Not tonight.

367
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,560
Hi. Really sorry.
We're in the middle
of something quite important.

368
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,960
- Have we met?
- Not yet. But we will.

369
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,920
In the past, I think.
If it's true.

370
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,640
I'm Claire.

371
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,920
If what's true, Claire?

372
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,040
You don't seem
too sure about your past.

373
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,040
Oh God, look at your faces.

374
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,520
I know,
I sound like a loon.

375
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,840
Don't let me distract you.

376
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,880
I didn't even know
you'd be here.
I was just...

377
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,840
taking the long way home.

378
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,840
'Cause it's Halloween.

379
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,200
Lupari fleet is getting closer.

380
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,320
We don't have any more time.
Come on, Yaz.

381
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
It's okay.

382
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,160
We'll see each other again.

383
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,240
Look after yourself.

384
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,080
Woah. That's not right.

385
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,120
The door's moved.

386
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
Yeah.

387
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,760
That's never happened before.

388
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,640
No.

389
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,600
You've got to
go home now, Claire.

390
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,440
Right, let's get
a lock on Karvanista.

391
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,840
- Co-pilot?
- Course.

392
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,320
Sending Karvanista's Craft ID.

393
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,960
Cross-referencing
with spatial-temporal locations,

394
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,960
I'll restrict to
this solar system
and time zone

395
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,160
for exact trajectory.

396
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,840
Yeah. I'll jam his radar,

397
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,920
and find a sweet spot
on his ship

398
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,000
for us to land unnoticed.

399
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,800
- Ah.
- Final adjustment?

400
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,920
Final adjustment.

401
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
Ah.

402
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,640
Right.

403
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,840
What are you doing?

404
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,040
Checking all systems
for malfunctions.

405
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,360
Also, quick MOT check
on my mind,
had a little glitch earlier.

406
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,200
What sort of glitch?
You didn't mention it.

407
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,560
You know what, Yaz,
I don't mention everything.

408
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,840
- No kidding.
- Are you being mardy?

409
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,360
What sort of glitch?

410
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,040
A glitchy glitch.
What does it matter?

411
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,480
Because I thought
we were friends.

412
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,720
We are friends.

413
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,760
Then why won't you let me in?

414
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,720
- What's going on with you?
- Nothing is going on with me.

415
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,240
Don't lie.

416
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,760
Have we not had
a good time together?

417
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,320
Since Ryan and Graham left,

418
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,600
- have I not taken you
to amazing places?
- Of course, but...

419
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,800
I thought I was showing you

420
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,200
experiences of a lifetime.

421
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,760
You're hiding something,

422
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,280
about him.

423
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,600
About why you tracked him down
in the first place.

424
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,000
Tell me.

425
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
What was that?

426
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,840
Temporal residue surrounding
Karvanista's ship.

427
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,960
Is it us or him?

428
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,760
Him. Very much him.

429
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,000
It's like his ship's
covered in it.

430
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,720
That shouldn't be happening.

431
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,080
We're pushing through it
to land.

432
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,760
Nothing is as it should be, Yaz.

433
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,280
Too much
out of the ordinary tonight.

434
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,080
Mustn't blink.

435
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,800
If you blink, it will move.

436
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,520
Don't blink.

437
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,680
Don't blink.

438
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,760
<i>The universe is looking
particularly beautiful today. </i>

439
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,760
Observation officer
Vinder reporting,

440
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,920
as per assigned duty.

441
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,840
Status report,
rotation number 21,754.

442
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,640
No activity.
No change in status.

443
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,360
Summary, constant.

444
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:30,040
Everything remains
as per my previous
21,753 reports.

445
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,440
Nothing has changed.

446
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,720
Nothing ever changes.

447
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,040
But then, you know that.

448
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,600
Additional comments.

449
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:45,040
My spirits remain high,
while there is little
or no activity.

450
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:55,400
The sheer beauty
of what I can see is...
unimaginable!

451
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,160
<i>I'm lucky to observe that
which few others will ever see. </i>

452
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,920
For that at least, I thank you.

453
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,680
In all other respects,

454
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,360
I conclude this report
with my usual
sign-off request,

455
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,160
that you all go to hell.

456
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,800
System?

457
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,240
<i>Yes, Commander.</i>

458
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,240
Amplify Thoribus section.

459
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,320
<i>Of course. Amplifying.</i>

460
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,960
What is that?

461
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,560
System, analyse and focus on
the Thoribus Trifecta.

462
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,920
<i>Analysing
Thoribus Trifecta.
Unknown phenomena detected.  </i>

463
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,920
<i>Analysing,
anomalous property detected. </i>

464
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,320
What in the name
of the saints...

465
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,480
<i>Thoribus minor
destroyed. </i>

466
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,600
<i>Unknown phenomena approaching.</i>

467
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,840
<i>Outpost Rose
is compromised. </i>

468
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,480
Emergency status update.
Urgent warning transmission.

469
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,240
-Jon?

470
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,400
Don't touch anything!

471
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,120
Why is this thought in my mind?

472
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
What thought?

473
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,640
Thank you.

474
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,280
My sister...
How I have missed you.

475
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,640
So we think this Dan bloke
is somewhere on board?

476
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,440
Yeah. Now just gonna take
out his security systems

477
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,600
before we get spotted.

478
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,680
And lay another hack.

479
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,720
Here, hold this.

480
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,160
Well... where is it?

481
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,720
Left over hopper virus particles
should do the trick.

482
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,080
Right, you find Dan.

483
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,720
I'll confront Karvanista,
meet back here.

484
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,080
Confront him?
Do you not remember
how that ended up last time?

485
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,280
Yes, we got away.

486
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,920
- Doctor!
- The prisoner's hold
is that way.

487
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,480
If you hear
gunfire or explosions,
get back sharpish.

488
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,000
Right, synchronise watches.

489
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,800
Forget that,
I'm not wearing a watch.
Any questions?

490
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,360
No? See you soon.

491
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,640
"Does that
make sense to you, Yaz?"
Not really Doctor, no.

492
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:28,200
Karvanista to Lupari command,
unknown temporal propulsion
has been corrected.

493
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,000
Now activating
strategic formation realignment
to rejoin battalion.

494
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,880
Also sharing mission intel
of Earth festival Halloween

495
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,920
which may affect
some operational deployments.

496
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,360
I've got a bone
to pick with you.

497
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,200
Oh, come on!

498
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,680
How many traps
do I have to leave
to get rid of you?

499
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,960
More than you have done so far.

500
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,440
I don't have time
for you right now.

501
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,480
You're gonna make time.

502
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,080
Did you just shut my ship down?

503
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,760
Yes, I did.

504
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,960
And now your weapon as well.

505
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,160
Because I've tracked you
down across
half the universe

506
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,440
and you're gonna stand there
while I tell you two things.

507
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,040
Number one, the Lupari invasion
of Earth is off.

508
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,360
What are you talking about?

509
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,960
I couldn't be clearer.

510
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You tell the rest of your people
to stay away from Earth.

511
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,960
It is protected, is protected,

512
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,480
protected by me, to be clear.

513
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,920
Number two,
you're gonna tell me everything
you know about The Division.

514
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,480
Dan Lewis, right?

515
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
Ow!

516
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,280
Might be. Who are you?

517
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,840
Rescue party.
Keep quiet and stay still.

518
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,440
It looks like this
holding pen has
nine different booby traps.

519
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,400
How do you know that?

520
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
I've had a lot
of experience of getting out
of places like this,

521
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,520
bear with me.

522
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,640
Where have you come from?

523
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,000
Why fussy about
who you get rescued by?

524
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,240
How do I know
I can trust you?

525
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,520
You might be
with the dog fella.

526
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,760
Does this look like a face
you can trust?

527
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,800
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

528
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,600
Are you an alien, too?

529
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,680
I am Yaz, Yasmin Khan.

530
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,880
Formerly PC Yasmin Khan
of Hallamshire Police

531
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,800
Very human, very much
not with dog fella.

532
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,520
Hallamshire, what?
Like Sheffield?

533
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,920
Why, what's the matter
with Sheffield?

534
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,400
Too near Leeds.

535
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,920
Pro tip, Dan Lewis,
don't diss
the designated rescuer.

536
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,840
How're you here,
if you're from Sheffield?

537
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,400
Got a mate who's an alien.

538
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,320
Does he look like a dog?

539
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,000
No, but she's got her own ship
and we can get you
back to Earth.

540
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,360
- You can come out.
- And the bars won't zap me?

541
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,720
Not if I've done it properly.
Which I'm pretty sure I have.

542
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,760
- How sure?
- Well, you know life's a gamble.

543
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,080
- Nice work, girl.
- Yaz is fine.

544
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,600
Now I don't want to
hear another word
against Yorkshire again.

545
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,920
Come on,
we're meeting the Doctor
back at our ship.

546
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,040
- Assuming nothing goes wrong.
- Why, do things often go wrong?

547
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,400
Come on!

548
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,000
<i>Stop asking
about The Division. </i>

549
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,400
That's not a question
I can answer.

550
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,680
Yes, you can.
You have to.

551
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,560
I've spent a long time
hunting you down.

552
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,800
You are the only known Division
operative, I can find alive.

553
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,120
The only one who can...
Right, sorry about that.

554
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,640
What is that call sign?

555
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,920
Why is it bothering me so much?

556
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,160
Species Recall.
Universal pattern.

557
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,560
That's it. Thank you!

558
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,200
No, what, wait!
You're on Species Recall?
Right now?

559
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,960
The Lupari are species,
bonded to humanity.

560
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,280
And for every human,

561
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,440
there's a paired guardian Lupar.

562
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,280
The bond is
our genetic obligation

563
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,680
and our honour.

564
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,840
Only ever to come into effect
in the ultimate crisis.

565
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,160
But that would mean
you're not abducting
Dan then?

566
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,320
I'm saving him, you idiot!

567
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,920
Right. Every Lupar has
a designated human.

568
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,800
He's mine, we have to save them,
before it's too late.

569
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,560
But you used a stun cube on him.

570
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,680
Just because we have to
save them

571
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,880
doesn't mean
I have to like them.

572
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,600
They're infuriating.

573
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,960
Seven billion ships.
Seven billion humans.

574
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,440
Man's best friend.

575
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,240
Not if you don't power up
my ship.

576
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,000
But what is it
you're saving them from?

577
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,680
You don't know?

578
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,000
I've been busy.

579
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,200
The Flux.

580
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,760
What's the Flux?

581
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,520
A hurricane, ripping through
the structure of this universe.

582
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,200
Disrupting every particle.

583
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,400
The falling of the structure
of the universe.

584
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,520
A cataclysm
of unknown proportions
or patterns.

585
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,680
We don't know for sure.

586
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,400
And when is this Flux
due to happen?

587
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,240
It's already begun.

588
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,840
<i>Update from
Thoribus Trifecta. </i>

589
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,600
<i>Three planets now compromised.</i>

590
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,280
Wait. No, I don't
mean compromised.

591
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,080
I mean destroyed.
Disintegrated.

592
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,440
But not by weapons.

593
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,800
Like they were folding in
on themselves,

594
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,120
because of proximity to...
I don't know what. System?

595
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,920
<i>Catastrophic event
compromising base level
integrity of all structures.  </i>

596
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,760
Did you mean something
is erasing this galaxy?

597
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,480
<i>Warning! Urgent update.</i>

598
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,080
<i>Observation Outpost Rose
will be compromised. </i>

599
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,800
<i>Evacuation procedures
urgently recommended. </i>

600
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,600
You hear that System advice?

601
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,440
This is Serving Commander
Inston Vee Vinder,

602
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,800
of Kasto-Winfer-Foxfell

603
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,360
doing the unthinkable
and leaving his post.

604
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,280
<i>
Escape procedures activated.
Survival pod ejection imminent. </i>

605
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,160
Data, I need data.

606
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,720
What causes this Flux?
And where does it start?

607
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,000
I don't know.
I don't have a guidebook to it.

608
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,640
The other side
of the universe
or somewhere.

609
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,880
Now, unblock my ship's systems.

610
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,480
I need to re-align
with my battalion.

611
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,480
Fine, doing it!

612
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,880
But I'm keeping your weapons
powered down.

613
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,440
It doesn't make any sense.

614
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,320
You're moving away from Earth
but the rest are travelling
towards it.

615
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,560
My ship hit a time disturbance
at the head of the battalion.

616
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,640
It meant I got to Earth

617
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,840
a few hours ahead of the others.

618
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,960
And your battalion
aim to transport humanity

619
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,040
off Earth before the Flux hits.

620
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,600
That's what species bond means,

621
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,520
to protect when called upon.

622
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,840
And how will this ship
survive the Flux?

623
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,360
Our survival battalion
was engineered
and built to weather

624
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,320
whatever the Flux
can throw at us.

625
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,760
Once the humans are on board,
the individual ships unite

626
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,680
to form a long-term
survival structure.

627
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,000
Clever, except has anyone asked
humanity about this?

628
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,640
Because I think they're
going to have an opinion.

629
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,360
We don't need to ask them.
We're protecting them.

630
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,960
Yeah, well, we don't want
your protection.

631
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
We were supposed to be
sneaking in quietly.

632
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,120
Sorry.

633
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,560
Did you release him?

634
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,920
Yeah, I did.

635
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,320
And that's payback for
dangling me over boiling acid.

636
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,000
All systems back online,
including weapons.

637
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
Right, plan modifications,
two stages.

638
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:39,480
One, this is not over,
between me and you,
we are not done.

639
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,680
Two, run!

640
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,840
- Dan, Doctor, Doctor, Dan!
- All right, Doc!

641
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,080
Nice to meet you Dan,
run for your life!

642
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,440
Give me back
my human.

643
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,840
That's my human.

644
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,240
I am not your human!

645
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,800
You said it was a ship.
That's not a ship.

646
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,440
It is, get in!

647
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,320
Why have you
put the door
on the floor?

648
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,600
Bit of a daft place
to have a door,
isn't it?

649
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,600
Seems to have a surplus
of doors right now,
I'm not sure why.

650
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,400
Is this all inside that box?

651
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,840
It's bigger on the inside.

652
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,400
I can see that.

653
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,760
It's called a TARDIS.

654
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,040
I had a mate
who had one of these.

655
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,440
I think his was
a bit bigger actually.

656
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,520
Shut up.

657
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,840
By the way,
here's your house.

658
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,960
What?
How did that happen?

659
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,840
Karvanista set a trap for us,
which miniaturised it.

660
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,640
I can't live in that.

661
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,880
Right now
you don't have a house.

662
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,560
Very soon you
may not have a planet

663
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,480
and there may not be a universe.

664
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,680
- Is she joking?
- Are you joking?

665
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,600
Not joking, I'm trying to locate
an event called the Flux.

666
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,720
Karvanista seems to think
it will overwhelm
most of the universe.

667
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,800
And you're looking for it?

668
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,080
We are.

669
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,680
Why don't I know about this?
And who else does?

670
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,680
Finally!

671
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,640
<i>Psychic Surveyor Kragar,
concluding assessment,
Commander.  </i>

672
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,880
It's been a long time,
old comrade.

673
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,000
You look old.

674
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,280
<i>My mission has withered me.
It is true. </i>

675
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,000
Really?
You look disgusting!

676
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,880
<i>Yes, Well,
no point dwelling on it. </i>

677
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,560
Really disgusting.

678
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,680
Continue.

679
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,760
<i>I have analysed
the psychic waves </i>

680
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,360
<i>and it is
my privilege to report </i>

681
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,120
<i>the cataclysm approaches.</i>

682
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,960
<i>The Flux is imminent.</i>

683
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,040
<i>I forecast
incredible suffering, </i>

684
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,080
<i>vast bloodshed.</i>

685
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,920
<i>A conflict that will dwarf
all that has come before. </i>

686
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,360
<i>The greatest of times
are upon us. </i>

687
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,080
<i>We must be ready
to take advantage. </i>

688
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:14,960
My old friend,
I find myself, excited!

689
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,080
<i>Yesss!</i>

690
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,440
Why have you
brought us here?

691
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,720
Multiple readings?
It's one event.

692
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,320
I said, trace one event.

693
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,840
In all of time and space
you bring us here, why?

694
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,920
- Who is she talking to?
- The TARDIS.

695
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,400
What, is it alive?

696
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,920
No idea, but they do chat.

697
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,040
It's brought us to the edge
of your solar system.

698
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,480
It doesn't make any sense.

699
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,600
There's nothing here.

700
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,280
Whoa,
when you say nothing...

701
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,760
Yeah, nothing here
except an amazing view.

702
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,240
How can we breathe?

703
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,640
Protective air bubble.

704
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,560
I'll take your word for it.

705
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,280
What is it?

706
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,440
- The Cloister Bell.
It's a warning.

707
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,520
- Of what?
- The TARDIS is worried.

708
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,560
What's that?

709
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,040
The Flux! This is what
the Lupari have seen.

710
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,920
What they were trying to protect
humanity from.

711
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,280
What's it doing?

712
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,880
Disobeying every law
of time and space.

713
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,080
Disrupting every particle
it comes into contact with.

714
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,600
Doctor, what's the matter?

715
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,480
- I can feel it all.

716
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,520
- I can feel
the universe breaking.

717
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,920
- But you can stop it, right?

718
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,960
<i>No.</i>

719
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,760
Hello again, Doctor.

720
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,880
Who are you?

721
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,160
They were so efficient.

722
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,400
There is not
a tiny corner of you
that remembers.

723
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,120
Remembers what?

724
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,440
You and I,

725
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:52,400
dancing across space and time,
locked in combat.

726
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,400
And now, after so long apart,
we get to do it once more.

727
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,360
I don't know you.

728
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,720
Yet, I know you.

729
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,400
I remember every battle.

730
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,680
Which gives me the advantage.

731
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,160
Our final fight has begun.

732
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,640
- Doctor, are you all right?

733
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,040
- Stop asking me that.

734
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,960
Is it me, or does it look like
it's changing direction?

735
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,560
It's like it's coming for us!

736
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,640
Get inside!

737
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,400
Do not stall on me now.

738
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,680
Taking evasive action.

739
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,520
Sorry!

740
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,640
Sorry!

741
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,680
Really sorry!

742
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,600
This is impossible!

743
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,160
The end of the Universe
is chasing us!

744
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,720
So what are you doing?

745
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,240
The only thing I can do.

746
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,640
If the Flux is coming for us,

747
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,960
then we're gonna head to Earth.

748
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,040
What?

749
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,760
<i>TARDIS
calling Karvanista! </i>

750
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,960
Bring me back my human, now!

751
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,480
<i>I am not your human!</i>

752
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,200
I'm trying to save
your worthless life.

753
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,160
Listen to me,
we are approaching you fast

754
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,240
and the Flux is right behind us.

755
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,600
Following us,
as we head to Earth.

756
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,320
It can't be.

757
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,800
We don't have enough time
to get all the humans
on board the ships.

758
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,600
The battalion's only on
the edge of the planet.

759
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,280
We have to have time, Doctor,
my family are there.

760
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,680
Mine too.
And Di.

761
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,160
I'm late to meet Diane.

762
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,040
<i>Diane,</i>

763
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:47,600
<i>inside the house.
Come on in. </i>

764
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,320
<i>I said...</i>

765
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,040
<i>come on in!</i>

766
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,680
Stop walking, Di.

767
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,440
Stop walking now.

768
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,200
No, no.

769
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,680
We're going to have
fun with you.

770
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,280
I've got a plan here!

771
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,080
There's only one chance
to survive this!

772
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,480
Karvanista, you said
the battalion ships
were designed to fit together

773
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,680
to form a protective structure.

774
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,040
What about it?

775
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,960
I am sending you a formation
for the ships,

776
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,800
get it communicated
to them instantly.

777
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,840
You have to move fast!

778
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,040
- What good will that do?
- Just do it!

779
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,840
<i>That shape, that formation,
got to outrun this thing. </i>

780
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,920
We are being dragged
into the heart of the Flux!

781
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,240
Can the TARDIS withstand it?

782
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,120
I don't know!
I don't understand it!

783
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,680
I hate not understanding.

784
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,880
Battalion positioned
just as you ordered!

785
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,200
Lock them into the pattern now!

786
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,440
This better work.

787
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,640
You're telling me!

788
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,840
Interlocking.

789
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,560
Lupari Battalion,
now encasing Earth.

790
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,880
It worked!
The pattern worked!

791
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,360
The battalion is
shielding Earth!

792
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,320
Your ships better be as good
as you say they are, Karvanista.

793
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,160
What about you?

794
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,200
Get your ship behind
that Battalion wall.

795
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,360
Doing it now!

796
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,560
Trouble, right?

797
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,560
I can't get us out of its pull!

798
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,880
We can't outrun it!

799
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,080
But we are safe in here.
We are sealed in.

800
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,720
Oh, no!

801
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,040
Come on, Doctor,
there must be something
you can do!

802
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,640
One last throw of the dice...

803
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,200
Get down!

804
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,400
Flux, meet Vortex energy.

805
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,960
See what that does to you!

806
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,520
Ah, not much
by the look of things.

807
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,120
Attack!

808
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,880
The end of the universe!

809
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,760
I always wondered
what it would feel like.

810
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,120
Please tell me you are not about
to engage Sontarans in battle?

811
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,640
Mrs Secole to you.

812
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,160
I accept your offer
of a massacre.
