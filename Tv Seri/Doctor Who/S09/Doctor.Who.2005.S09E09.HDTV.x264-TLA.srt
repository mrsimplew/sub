You must not watch this.

00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,800
I'm warning you.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,200
You can never unsee it.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,140
But if you do watch...

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,950

into some kind of order

so that you can understand,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,950
so you can have some idea.

There are bits missing. Sorry about that.

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't fully understand
what's been going on here.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,540
But, er...

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,950

'Bit of an attitude, in my opinion.'

Calm down, pet!

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,950
Well, it's ridiculous!

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,950
That thing's meant to be
a lethal fighting machine

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,950
and it just moons around
like a love-sick puppy!

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,950
I could hear you ranting

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,950
- from inside the pod, Chopra, for the Gods' sake!
- Feel better?

The one thing they couldn't
get their filthy mitts on.

Now, they're even grabbing
that! Colonising it.

- Don't call me that.

- "Don't call me that, ma'am." Give it a rest, pet.
- Give what a rest?

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,950
This is a mission, Chopra. We find
out what's happened on Le Verrier

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,950
and then we all go home. Keep
your politics to yourself, OK?

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,950
I know someone who'd love to get Chopra

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,950

- Ho-ho!

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,950
What the hell happened here?

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,950
- Hide seek.
- Maybe they play hide seek.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,950
Hide AND seek! Why do they miss
out words? It's infuriating!

Faulty filament. Three-day week.

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,950
- So, orbit around Neptune?
- Yeah. This close into the planet,

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,950
they must have some pretty powerful
anti-grav shielding on board.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,950
Looks like a Japanese restaurant.

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,950
Oh! Have you brought me
to a space restaurant!?

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,950
- People never do that, you know?
- Do what?

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,950
They never put the word
"space" in front of something

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,950
just because everything's all
sort of hi-tech and future-y.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,950
It's never "space restaurant"
or "space champagne"

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,950
or "space"... you know..."hat".

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,950
It's just "restaurant",
"champagne" or "hat".

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,950
Even if this was a restaurant...

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,950

- From the beginning of time?

- That's a very long story.
- (Doctor...!)

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,950
Well, we just arrived, you know,
and there was nobody about.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,540
Well, what are you doing here?

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,950
24 hours ago, this station fell silent.

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,950
No comm signal. Nothing. Dead.

Theories?

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,950
Could be anything. Meteorite strike.

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,950
Space pirates...

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,950
Ah, see? Not just
"pirates". "SPACE pirates"!

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,950
- So, what, you are a rescue mission?
- Yes.

110
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,270
- Of four?
- Cuts, pet.

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,950

After the Great Catastrophe,
there was a tectonic realignment.

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,470
India and Japan, they were...

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,950
.. sort of merged.

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,950
We still don't know where the
rest of the crew are, though.

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,950
I mean, a place this size...

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,950
Hey, what? "Great Catastrophe"?

126
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,270

Well... You've got all that to

Mind you,

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
this place looks as if it's
been dead for a long while now.

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,600
What is it?

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,950
I still can't shake the feeling.

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,950

That's how they're grown. You know
that. They react to any attack.

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,950
"Grown"?! They might not
give them much upstairs,

146
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,950
but our friend here
certainly knows how to fight.

You'd be glad of her in
a tight corner, I'll bet.

become those creatures?

You saw what happened.

358
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,950
The dust conglomerates. It moulds
itself into a humanoid form.

359
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,950
It's adaptable. It's clever.

those monsters wouldn't find me.

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
THUDDING AND GROWLING

526
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,950
Doctor, that door isn't
going to last much longer.

527
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,940
So, what do we do?

528
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,950
We let them in.

529
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,340
What?!

530
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,800
We let them in.

531
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,950
Hmm. Clever, that.

532
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,950
Clever strategy.

533
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,950
If they'd stayed in there,
they'd have frozen to death.

534
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
So, the Doctor had to let the
creatures in. That was his theory.

535
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Oh, I'm not dead.

536
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,870
You've probably guessed that by now.

537
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
CREATURE GROWLS

538
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:41,950
CLUNKING

539
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,950
What happen?

540
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,950
Must be damage from when
we fell out of orbit.

541
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,950
THEY COUGH AND SPLUTTER

542
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
We have to go back.

543
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,950
CREATURE ROARS

544
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I don't know what to do. I can't save us.

545
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
- 474 can. - What?! - PUNCH LANDS

546
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
CREATURE MURMURS AND GROWLS

547
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,950
HE MOUTHS SILENTLY

548
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,950
The Doctor worked it out.

549
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,400
The creatures... can't see.

550
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,950
CREATURE GROWLS

551
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Sssh!

552
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
- CLATTERING
- Run! Engine room!

553
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,950
What happened?

554
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
HOARSELY: 474 help.

555
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,340
What?!

556
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,950
474... die soon.

557
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,950
No, no! Don't say that!
You got us through!

558
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,950
You can survive this!

559
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,950
CREATURES ROAR

560
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,540
Chopra go.

561
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,950
Get ship.

562
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Chopra be safe.

563
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,740
Chopra pretty.

564
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Yaaaargh!

565
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,950
You said you felt like you
were being watched, Clara.

566
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
- "Paranoia", you said.
- Not this time.

567
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:06,950
There is a feed. Wireless.

568
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,950
These images are being
stored by someone. Collated.

569
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,950
Nagata, look at this footage!

570
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,950
What's wrong with it?

571
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,950
- What's wrong with it?
- Don't know.

572
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,950
Look, there's one very
obvious thing about it.

573
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,950
Do you see it yet?

574
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
No? OK. I'll tell you what's wrong.

575
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,950
There's footage here of everyone.

576
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,950
But what's missing in all of it?

577
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,470
What can't you see anywhere?

578
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,940
Not in the footage, not on this ship.

579
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:38,950
Look...

580
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Really look.

581
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,950
There are no cameras here.

582
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,950
No CCTV.

583
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,950
No helmet cams.

584
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So, how and why does
this footage even exist?

585
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,950
The dust has been watching us.

586
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Each little organic speck...

587
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,950
.. just a tiny spy!

588
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,950
Drifting through the air.

589
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,950
The monsters have been with us all along.

590
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,950
That's why the Sandmen are blind.

591
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Their visual receptors are being
hijacked! But by whom, and why?

592
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,200
And then, there's this.

593
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:16,950
That's you, Clara.

594
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,340
That's you, looking at me.

595
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,140
Me?

596
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,140
You went into the pod.

597
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,600
The Morpheus process has begun.

598
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:31,950
Well...

599
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,950
There's nothing here from
Chopra's point of view

600
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,950
because he refuses to use Morpheus.

601
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,950
But everybody else is here. Including you.

602
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,600
You don't have a camera, Clara.

603
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,950
But you will have by now,

604
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,940
sleep in your eye.

605
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:50,950
OK, well, we'll fix this.

606
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,950
You will fix this.

607
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,950
Yes. I'm sure it'll be fine.
I'm sure you'll be fine.

608
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,950
Sure?

609
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,950
We will sort this, Clara.

610
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,950
We'll sort you. We'll sort Nagata.

611
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,950
And everyone back on Triton.

612
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And then we will destroy Morpheus forever.

613
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,400
OK then.

614
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,070
Let's get on with it.

615
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,950
The power's been almost
entirely out since we arrived.

616
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
But we've still got emergency lighting.

617
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,950
But the engines are still on.

618
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Well, there was that incident
with the grav-shields, but...

619
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,950
Ah! What, what, what?

620
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,950
The grav-shields didn't fail.

621
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,950
They were deliberately powered down.

622
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
By the Sandmen?

623
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,870
Well, that's not their style, is it?

624
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
It's like... It's like
something's been kept here.

625
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,950
Near the engines. Where it's hot.

626
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,950
Like something's being...

627
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,600
kept alive.

628
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,950
COMPUTER: 'Warning! Dangerous
materials in transit.

629
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,950
'Human contact not advised.

630
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,950
'Warning! Dangerous materials in transit.

631
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,470
'Human contact not advised.'

632
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,950
Well, you said someone's
watching. Collating images.

633
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,950
- Yeah. - Well, if it's not
the Sandmen, then who is it?

634
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,950
I have an idea who.

635
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
A very... nasty idea.

636
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,950
In the absence of any further
communication with Chief Nagata

637
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and the others, I must regrettably
assume them to be deceased.

638
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,950
Under the circumstances, I'm
now returning to the ship

639
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
and will begin preparations
to destroy Le Verrier station.

640
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,950
DOORS SLIDE OPEN

641
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,950

642
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
WEAPON POWERS UP

643
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,950
Who's there?

644
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,340
Chief?!

645
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
HE WHIMPERS

646
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,950
GROWLING

647
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
SCREAMING

648
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,950
"Rescue ship"?

649
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
- Why are we going to the rescue ship?
- Because that's where he'll be.

650
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,950
'Gagan Rassmussen. I'm Gagan Rassmussen.

651
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
'This is Le Verrier lab
in orbit around Neptune.

652
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,950
'I've put things together
into some kind of order...'

653
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,950
You had that prepared well
in advance, didn't you?

654
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,950
Your statement.

655
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,950
Your alibi.

656
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,950
There would inevitably be
questions when you got to Triton.

657
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So, you needed to get your story straight.

658
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,950
'This is what happened.'

659
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,400
CLANKING

660
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,950
You can't fight them, Doctor.

661
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,870
There's no point.

662
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:20,950
They're the future.

663
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,950
A new life form!

664
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,950
A BETTER life form.

665
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,950
That's very clear to me now.

666
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,400
They've made me understand.

667
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:35,950
And we're to be their food

668
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,950
and that's only correct.

669
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,950
I just needed to find a way
to get them off this station,

670
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,950
and back to Triton. And
then, they'll spread.

671
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,950
- Spread everywhere.
- And that's what you want?!

672
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,950
You're helping them wipe out Humanity?

673
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,950
Things have been made very clear to me!

674
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,950
We saw you die!

675
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,950
The Sandmen swallowed you...

676
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,950
I think the Professor has been
playing a long game. Am I right?

677
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,950
They speak to me...

678
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,950
in my mind.

679
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Trust me, I think...

680
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,340
But they're like children.

681
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:07,950
Babies.

682
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,340
So new.

683
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,950
Evolving.

684
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,950
Hungry.

685
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,950
Always so hungry.

686
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,950
I made them understand.

687
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,950
We had to find a way out.

688
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,950
And then there'd be new food sources.

689
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,950
Unlimited.

690
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,950
So, they spared me.

691
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,740
And we waited.

692
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
You and your cargo?

693
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,950
I got it in here while
you were all distracted.

694
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,340
BEEPING

695
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
What's in there?

696
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,270
Dust?

697
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,950
It's like smuggling a jam jar
full of germs through customs.

698
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,950
No. No.

699
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
More than that.

700
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,870
What do you mean?

701
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,950
I've been working on Morpheus
for a very long time, Doctor.

702
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,950
I had to start somewhere.

703
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,270
Morpheus's first client.

704
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,670
Patient Zero.

705
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,270
The ultimate Wide-Awake.

706
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,950
Inside there...

707
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,950
is a man who hasn't slept in five years.

708
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,950
Or what's left of him.

709
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,950
He's the well-spring.

710
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,950
Once we get to Triton,
he will spread his spores.

711
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,950
But you said it was an encoded signal.

712
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,950
Something electronic
in the Morpheus process

713
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,950
that changed the chemical
reaction in the brain.

714
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,950
That's how it started, yes.

715
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,950
But it's changing all the time.

716
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,950
Evolving new ways to infect.

717
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,950
To flourish.

718
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,950
Whole moons, whole planets,

719
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,950
whole civilisations.

720
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,950
They'll spread everywhere.

721
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,950
You know I can't allow that.

722
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,950
You can't stop them.

723
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,950
- None of us can.
- GUN CLACKS

724
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
- WEAPON POWERS UP
- I wouldn't bet on that, pet.

725
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,950
BEEPING

726
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
GROWLING

727
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,950
BLASTER SHOTS

728
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,950
Doctor!

729
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Doctor!

730
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,950
What he wants is to get
that thing off this ship.

731
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,870
- We have to stop him.
- Any ideas?

732
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,950
The doors are not a problem.

733
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,740
[But that is!]

734
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
We need a distraction.

735
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,950
When I say "run", run.

736
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,950
GROWLING

737
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,950
Hey! Sandy!

738
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
- ♪ Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom... ♪
- Run!

739
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,950
♪ Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom

740
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,950
♪ Mr Sandman, bring me your dreams... ♪

741
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,950
Rassmussen!

742
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,950
Turn off the engines. Shut this ship down!

743
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,950
I can't do that, I'm afraid, Doctor.

744
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,950
We can't fight the inevitable.
Humanity's day is done.

745
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,950
Yeah? Well, Humanity might have
something to say about that, pet.

746
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,950
- GUNSHOT
- Aargh! - No!

747
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,950
HE GROANS

748
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,950
- Is that your answer for everything?!
- Did you have a better one?

749
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,950
He's not the only one dead.

750
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,950
According to this data, we're the
only ones left alive on this station.

751
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,950
GROWLING AND THUDDING

752
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,470
Doctor...

753
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,540
Come on, man! We've got to go!

754
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:34,950
- This doesn't make any sense.
- What?

755
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,950
A man who hasn't slept for five years...

756
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,950
Well, you heard what he said.
That's the first Morpheus patient!

757
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,950
But the dust consumes the host.

758
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,950
And then they make
Sandmen, they conglomerate.

759
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,950
We escaped from that cold storage
room because they were blind.

760
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,950
And why power down the
grav-shields when he did?

761
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,950
It's like this is all for effect...

762
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,950
Look, can we maybe have this conversation

763
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,950
when we get off this thing?

764
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,950
.. like a story.

765
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,400
Come on!

766
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
THUDDING AND GROWLING

767
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
- How do we get off this crate?
- Alternative transport.

768
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,950
We have to get to Triton. Destroy
all the Morpheus machines.

769
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,950
- End this.
- This is how we get home?

770
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I've never been so pleased to see...

771
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
CREATURES GROWL

772
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,340
Nagata!

773
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,950
Doctor, quickly!

774
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,950
HE MURMURS

775
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
BEEPING

776
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,950
- What did you just do?
- Self-destructed the grav-shields.

777
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,950
- What?!
- Urgh!

778
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
THEY GRUNT

779
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:00,950
It's working!

780
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,950
Neptune's gravity is pulling
them apart, bit by bit!

781
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,950
Doesn't make sense.

782
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,470
None of this makes any sense.

783
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,950
Hello again!

784
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,950
Thing is, you see, this
message, this testament,

785
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,950
it wasn't just my alibi. It was my plan.

786
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,950
There are no spores. No infection.

787
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,950
The Morpheus process remains the same.

788
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,950
An electronic signal that affects
the sleep centres of the brain.

789
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,950
Changes them.

790
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,950
An electronic signal that's
contained in this recording.

791
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,950
There it is.

792
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,950
Tickles, doesn't it?

793
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,950
I've just got time to fit this bit
in and then I can finish the story.

794
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,950
Then I'm going to transmit this
footage to the whole Solar System.

795
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,950
I do hope you've enjoyed the show.

796
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,950
I did try to make it exciting.
All those scary bits.

797
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,950
All those death-defying scrapes,

798
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,950
monsters, and a proper climax
with a really big one at the end!

799
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,950
Compulsive viewing.

800
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I did tell you not to watch.

801
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
VOICE DISTORTS: There's nothing
left of Rassmussen any more.

802
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,400
Only us.

803
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,400
Only us.

804
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,950
You will show this film
to your family, won't you?

805
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,950
And your friends.

806
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,950
And everyone, really.

807
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,950
Then we can all be together,

808
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
dust to dust.

809
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,950
Excuse me,

810
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,950
you've got something...

811
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
there...

812
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,740
.. just in the corner of your eye.

813
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
FADING LAUGHTER

814
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,950
Rigsy! Hey, what's wrong?

815
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,950
So, I have this, er... It
kinda looks like a tattoo.

816
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,950
- There's no nice way to say
you're about to die. - What?!

817
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,950
I don't know who did this to you,

818
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,950
but I do almost certainly
know how to find them.

819
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,950
So, this is your life, then,
bouncing around time saving people?

820
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,950
There have always been rumours,
mutterings about hidden streets.

821
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,950
Secret pockets of alien
life, right here on Earth.

822
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,950
Peace on this street depends on one thing.

823
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
To break it is to face the Raven.
