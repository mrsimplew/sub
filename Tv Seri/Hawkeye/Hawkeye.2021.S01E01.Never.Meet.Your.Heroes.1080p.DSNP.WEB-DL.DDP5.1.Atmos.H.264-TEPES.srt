1
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,083
Needed their signatures.

2
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,666
I'm telling you, it's not a problem.

3
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,250
We have to wait a little.
The market's gonna turn around

4
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,041
and everything will be fine.

5
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,666
Okay. We have to sell the penthouse.

6
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,250
No. We don't.

7
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,958
-That's, that's--
-What? An actual solution?

8
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,875
Maybe growing up in this place,
you got used to the idea

9
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:10,000
that a solution will
just fall out of the sky. But it won't.

10
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,541
You've got a daughter to think of.

11
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,208
I've got it under control, Eleanor.

12
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,916
Do you want to?

13
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,000
Who are we kidding? You go.

14
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,083
Kate?

15
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,500
Coming in.

16
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,875
You shouldn't eavesdrop.

17
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,625
Then how would I know
what you're saying when I'm not there?

18
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,291
I don't know how to argue with that.

19
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,666
How much did you hear?

20
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,166
I don't want to move.

21
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,583
That much, huh?

22
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,875
-We don't have to.
-How do you know?

23
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,166
Mommy said things
don't just fall from the sky.

24
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,750
Well, yeah,
but there's always gonna be weather.

25
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,958
Some people forget
the one thing they can control,

26
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,041
the choices they make in the face of it.

27
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:20,291
What would you do in a hurricane?

28
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,166
I would do what I always do.

29
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,333
Protect you.

30
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,875
Now, why don't you go have
some lunch with your mom?

31
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,041
Think fast.

32
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,208
I'll be downstairs in my office.

33
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,916
Mommies can be
pretty fun, too, you know.

34
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,000
I bet you didn't know I could do this.

35
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,625
Made you smile.

36
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:03,916
Come on.

37
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,083
Why don't you go grab the <i>Checkers?</i>
We can liven things up.

38
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,291
-All right. Yeah.
-Yeah?

39
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,208
Okay, I'm going downstairs,
I'll be right back.

40
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,291
Okay.

41
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,166
Mommy!

42
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,583
Mommy? Mommy, what's happening?

43
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,541
Mommy!

44
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,416
Daddy, where are you?

45
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,166
Dad?

46
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,625
Dad. Daddy, where are you?

47
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,375
Mommy!

48
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,125
Kate!

49
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,791
We have to get out of here.

50
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,083
Is Daddy okay?

51
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,041
Dad!

52
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,291
Dad! Dad!

53
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,583
<i>Daddy!</i>

54
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,875
I'm so sorry, my dear.

55
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,291
What if they come back?

56
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,541
They won't come back.

57
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,000
How do you know?

58
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,833
Because the heroes
showed them what would happen.

59
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,916
And even though this is scary,

60
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,750
I'm still the luckiest woman in the world

61
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,708
because I have
the greatest little girl in the world.

62
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,041
Who is not that little.

63
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,041
I need to protect us.

64
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,708
Kate, that's my job.

65
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:46,833
Okay?

66
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:50,083
Whatever you need, I'm here for you.

67
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,666
I need a bow and arrow.

68
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:48,791
Ugh! Come on!

69
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,375
<i>Kate, be careful.</i>

70
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,833
<i>If we get caught, you're definitely</i>
<i>gonna be kicked off the archery team.</i>

71
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,500
Yeah, I know. But a bet's a bet, Greer.

72
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,375
Okay, so the real question.

73
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:39,541
Does the bell swing back and forth,
or the dangly thingy swing back and forth?

74
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,750
It's obviously the bell.

75
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,458
See? I would disagree.

76
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,916
I think it's the dangly thingy.

77
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,791
<i>Nice outfit by the way, Kate.</i>

78
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,166
Yeah, well,

79
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,958
sometimes, you gotta dress the part.

80
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,166
<i>I know it's a bet,</i>

81
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,333
but are you sure
that arrow won't damage it?

82
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:57,791
No.

83
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,375
Well, that was a bit of a letdown.

84
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,083
Okay, you know what, just hang on.

85
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,833
Hang on.

86
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,666
Let me just fix this. Give me a second.

87
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:59,416
Oh, my God!
That was amazing! Wow!

88
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,583
Nice, Kate.

89
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,333
That's fine.

90
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:13,875
Right? I mean, it gives it character.
All famous bells have cracks in them.

91
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,583
All right, that's, uh, that's not great.

92
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,458
<i>But it could be worse.</i>

93
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,416
This is bad.

94
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,458
Hold it!

95
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,666
Dad?

96
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,333
Dad?

97
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,958
Did you turn your hearing aid off?

98
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,416
No, honey, I know what happens.

99
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,708
I was there.

100
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,041
You know who wasn't there?
Is that guy.

101
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,583
Ant-Man.

102
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,541
You look pretty cool though.

103
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,458
That's a plus.

104
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,083
I'll be right back.

105
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,833
-Hmm.

106
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,416
Oh, uh, a selfie
would be really rad, dude.

107
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,916
My kids would flip.
I mean, you're their absolute favorite.

108
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,791
Yeah, uh...

109
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,833
Now's not really the appropriate time.

110
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,500
Is now a better time?

111
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,166
Wow.

112
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,833
-Hey, are you okay?
-Oh, hey, yeah.

113
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,000
Yeah, yeah. I, uh, just wanted
to come out for some, uh...

114
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,083
Some fresh air, is all.

115
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,833
You know it's fine if you don't
wanna watch the show. I mean...

116
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,708
I know everyone misses her, but...

117
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,458
she was your best friend. It's...

118
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,000
Come here, baby.

119
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,875
This whole thing
is a bit ridiculous, isn't it?

120
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,541
A lot ridiculous.

121
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,750
-The Hulk part was great.
-Yeah, I liked the Hulk.

122
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,125
Hey, Dad. Hey, Lila.

123
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,875
Hey, guys! What's up?
What are you doing here?

124
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,875
Why is everyone singing
and dancing about everything?

125
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,875
I don't know.

126
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,000
But it's Christmas in New York.
And we're out of here. Right?

127
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,458
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

128
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,750
-NATHANIEL: All right.
-Let's show Mom what she's missing.

129
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,875
-NATHANIEL: Yeah.
-Come on, bud.

130
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,250
Hey, Mom!

131
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,125
<i>Hey, honey! I missed you.</i>

132
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,958
<i>-Uh, are you in the city?</i>
-KATE: Yeah, I, uh, I am.

133
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,291
I was gonna stop by my place
and then come see you.

134
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,250
<i>Will you come here first, please?</i>
<i>Jack's over.</i>

135
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,041
<i>I want to talk to you about something.</i>

136
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,291
Okay, uh, okay.
I'll, uh, see you soon, Mom.

137
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,541
Good evening, Miss Bishop.

138
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,208
How's it going? Good?
Wife, kids, all good?

139
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,333
Wonderful, wonderful, Merry Christmas!

140
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,541
-ELEANOR: Hi, sweetie.
-KATE: Hi, Mom.

141
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,750
There you are.

142
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,000
Oh, you look amazing.

143
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,083
What are we looking all fancy for?

144
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,583
Charity auction.

145
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,208
-Ugh.
-I know, right?

146
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,541
All those poor people and nonprofits
relying on the more fortunate.

147
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,958
That is not what I meant.

148
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,041
As much as I love having
you home for the holidays,

149
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:08,083
I'm not thrilled that I'm about
to replace an irreplaceable clock tower.

150
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,875
It was a bell tower.

151
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,500
The Dean said it had a bell and a clock,

152
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:15,791
and overachiever that you are,
you managed to destroy both.

153
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,500
What can I do to make it better, Mom?

154
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,666
I started by cancelling your credit cards,

155
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,208
and we're going to have a much longer talk
about this tower that you destroyed,

156
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,291
without joking.

157
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,833
I know young people
think they're invincible,

158
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:34,083
and rich people think they're invincible
and you've always been both.

159
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,750
So take it from someone
who hasn't, you're not.

160
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,708
You will get hurt.

161
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,000
So please, don't go out looking for it.

162
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,541
Sorry, Mom.

163
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,041
Sorry.

164
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,750
Okay.

165
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,333
You get that from your father, you know.

166
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,416
Why don't you start making it up to me

167
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,083
by putting on that red dress in
your bedroom and coming with me tonight?

168
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,666
All right, well, um,

169
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,666
on another note,

170
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,166
I got a new one for the case.

171
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,791
U.S. Open Martial Art Championship.

172
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,875
You're amazing. I still remember
when you got your black belt at 15.

173
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:28,041
We might have to retire some from
when you were little to make room. Huh?

174
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,375
-I like those.
-ELEANOR: I do, too, hon.

175
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,500
I do, too.

176
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,416
What's with all the swords, Mom?

177
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:43,083
Hon, uh, there have been a few changes
while you were away this semester.

178
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,625
Ta-da!

179
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:45,708
Jack?

180
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,458
Oh.

181
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,541
What an unexpected surprise.

182
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,791
All surprises are unexpected.

183
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,958
That can't be right. Is it?

184
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,916
Nice to see you again, Katie.

185
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:00,875
That was in your mouth.

186
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,208
So it was.

187
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,958
We cannot be late, so go change.

188
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,958
Meet us at the hotel
and we'll talk there. Okay?

189
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,333
-Shall we?
-Let's.

190
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,708
We'll see you at the party.

191
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,291
See you there, honey.

192
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,583
Lots more to talk about.

193
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,916
You look like a maniac.

194
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,500
You're a total crazy person.

195
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,041
Is anybody else hungry?

196
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,958
For some more, like, some more crabs
or maybe get four more crabs?

197
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,875
-What do you think?
-Yes. I could eat three.

198
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,083
-No.
-COOPER: Come on, Dad,

199
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,041
you ordered food for 30 people.

200
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,333
You're going to puke if you have any more.

201
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:43,583
And if he pukes,
you two are cleaning it up.

202
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,916
I'm not cleaning it up.

203
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,958
Hey, you know what?
You know what's right down the street?

204
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:52,125
The Christmas tree.
The biggest one you'll see in your life.

205
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,458
It's enormous!
You want to see that after this?

206
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,000
-Yeah!
-Yeah! Let's go.

207
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,625
-Oh, wait, wait, wait.

208
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,666
Momma callin'. Momma's calling. Say "Hi!"

209
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,458
-Hi, Mom!
-Hi, Momma!

210
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,166
Hey, guys! How are ya?

211
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,708
I miss you so much!

212
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,625
-We miss you, too.
-LAURA: <i>How was the show?</i>

213
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,666
It was, uh-- It's over. It was big.

214
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,666
-We left halfway through.
-There you go.

215
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,875
Oh, no!

216
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,750
You guys all good?

217
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,916
<i>Uh, yeah,</i>
<i>it'd be easier if you were here.</i>

218
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,125
I'd be less likely to strangle these kids.

219
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,500
<i>The whole point was for you</i>
<i>to spend time with the kids.</i>

220
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:28,458
No, I'm kidding.
We're having a really good time.

221
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,333
-We miss you.
-I miss you.

222
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,875
-I can't wait to see you guys tomorrow.
-LILA: <i>Bye, Mom!</i>

223
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,416
-LILA: Bye, Mom! Love you!
-Bye, Mom.

224
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,416
-Talk to you later. See you soon.
-NATHANIEL: Bye-bye.

225
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,375
Well, look, it's six days
until Christmas, okay?

226
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,666
We're gonna do a lot of activities.
What's your favorite one?

227
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,291
-Um, gingerbread house.
-We're doing that!

228
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:46,458
What do you got?

229
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,666
Uh, Christmas movie marathon.

230
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,000
Movie marathon, awesome!

231
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,541
-Uh, ugly sweaters.
-Ugly Christmas sweaters!

232
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,583
We have to decorate the tree.
There's a thousand things to do.

233
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,875
It's going to be amazing,
but most important thing,

234
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,166
we're going to do it all together.

235
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,791
No. Not holding their hands.

236
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,291
Hold your brothers' hands.

237
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:05,791
I love you guys.

238
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:06,875
Love you, too.

239
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,208
It's going to be
the best Barton Christmas ever!

240
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,291
All right?

241
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:13,500
-Please.
-Yeah.

242
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:14,708
Dinner is on us.

243
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,666
-Thank you.
-Oh, that's, that's not necessary.

244
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,291
It's necessary. You saved our city.

245
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,875
Oh. Thank you.

246
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,208
Thank you, sir.

247
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,000
-NATHANIEL: Thank you!
-COOPER: Thank you.

248
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:42,750
Uh, get back to work.

249
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,375
-Excuse me dear, would you--
-Sorry, I'm not a waitress.

250
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,000
You're the little Bishop girl.

251
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,750
Yes, I am.

252
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:02,000
-Armand. Armand Duquesne.
-Ah.

253
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,750
You used to come to my brownstone
for brunch.

254
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:06,500
Oh, build your own blintz bar.

255
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,458
Precisely.

256
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,625
You know, it's unfair.

257
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:14,916
I never looked
that good in a tuxedo in my life.

258
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,375
I'd appreciate it if you wear something
a little more lady-like for the wedding,

259
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,875
so we won't be competing.

260
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:21,708
What wedding?

261
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:22,916
You don't know?

262
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,291
Eleanor and Jack.

263
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:29,666
Oh! Those secretive little love birds!

264
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:35,583
-WAITER: Can I offer you some champagne?
-Thank you!

265
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:40,458
Believe me, I've done everything
in my power to talk him out of it.

266
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,666
When he gets something
set in that little mind of his,

267
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,875
he can be quite determined.

268
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:48,791
Oh.

269
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:51,291
Seems like he won the jackpot.

270
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,541
You think so?

271
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,708
So does he.

272
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:56,416
I'm not so sure.

273
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,875
Armand, I wanna go home. I'm bored.

274
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:05,125
That's no way to talk, Armand.
That's not the way you were brought up.

275
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,041
Come and say hello to Miss Bishop.

276
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,375
Hey.

277
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:10,458
Hello.

278
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,625
Another Armand, I see.

279
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:16,541
Yes. I'm Armand the third
and he's Armand the seventh.

280
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,583
I believe that's quite sufficient.

281
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:23,666
Well, uh, I'm gonna
make my excuses because it seems that

282
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,791
you need to have a chat

283
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:30,208
with your prize of a mother.

284
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:34,166
Come on, Armand. Come on, boy!

285
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:53,666
You're engaged?

286
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,458
Oh, well, I guess
the beans are out of the bag.

287
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,041
Well, can we have a little moment?

288
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,083
Oh, of course, it's almost time
for my other engagement anyway.

289
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:05,166
Bye.

290
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:14,083
Babe, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry you found out this way.

291
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:16,416
I don't know, Mom, this is just like...

292
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:19,250
-Fast.
-Yeah, yeah, it's fast, yes.

293
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:22,541
But, you know, it's kind of nice
being swept up in the romance of it.

294
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:26,125
Is there a part of you
that could be happy for me?

295
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,041
Yes.

296
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:31,583
Yes, Mom, of course.

297
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:36,333
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I wanted to tell you first. I'm sorry.

298
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:39,416
-I'm going to get some air, Mom.
-I understand.

299
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,666
Yep.

300
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,125
-Come back and find me, okay?
-KATE: Yeah.

301
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:06,916
-Hi.

302
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:09,958
Heck of a party, huh?

303
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:30,291
I should've known
that this empire of yours

304
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:32,083
would be built on a lie.

305
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:35,791
By myself from the ground up.
So whatever you think you saw is not true.

306
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:37,500
Don't insult my intelligence.

307
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,333
You're frankly insulting us both.

308
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:41,416
-I know what I saw.
-You are all just--

309
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,916
Don't you try that on me.

310
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:48,583
I gave you an opportunity
to explain yourself.

311
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:50,291
I don't want to argue with you.

312
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:55,208
I've got powerful friends, too.
The kind you don't want to mess with.

313
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Please.

314
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:58,208
Armand!

315
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:05,541
See you at Christmas dinner.

316
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:10,416
Mom, what was that about?
Is that guy threatening you?

317
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,416
I honestly-- I have no idea.

318
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,333
Why are you lurking in the hallways?

319
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:17,916
-KATE: I was outside getting air.
-Come back to the party.

320
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,416
-KATE: Okay. All right.
-Okay.

321
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:21,750
-KATE: Be right there.
-ELEANOR: All right.

322
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:42,500
-Be right back.
-Okay.

323
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:58,666
Gary wants you to bring
these down, right away.

324
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,166
-Just these two?
-These two.

325
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:48,791
This seat is taken.

326
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:57,333
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be seated, and we will begin.

327
00:28:57,416 --> 00:29:00,125
I've reached
my breaking point with your fiancée.

328
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:04,041
Things are about to get very ugly.

329
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:06,625
Why don't we leave Eleanor alone,
you old goat.

330
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:10,000
For our first item
of the evening,

331
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,833
we will be traveling back in time.

332
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:17,291
We'll start the bidding for this
magnificent skull at $2 million.

333
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,541
Do I hear $2 million?

334
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:20,583
<i>Bidder bidder,</i> two-point-one.

335
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:22,583
I got $2 million,
do I hear two-point-one?

336
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:25,458
Two-point-one, thank you so much, sir.
Do I hear two-point-two?

337
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:27,458
-Do I hear two-point-two?
-Excuse me?

338
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:29,250
Hey, excuse me!

339
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:32,458
Oh, perfect!

340
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,166
-Oh.
-Great.

341
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:37,666
I was supposed
to be the only one working here.

342
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:42,166
Gary? Gary sent me to work here.

343
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:45,458
So maybe if you want to bother Gary...

344
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:49,166
You're doing great. Okay.

345
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:51,875
Two million seven,
now two million eight.

346
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,125
I've got two million seven
right here, going once.

347
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:57,166
I've got two-point-seven going twice.

348
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:01,208
Sold for $2.7 million.

349
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:05,916
Thank you. And I will remind you
that this is for home display only.

350
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:09,083
And you have no idea where you got it.

351
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:15,541
Who told you to come down here?

352
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:17,625
Gary.

353
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:19,791
I'm Gary.

354
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:21,208
What's your name?

355
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,958
You see that's the problem, Gary,

356
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,666
you don't even know my name.

357
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,750
You know, uh, this is,
this is not gonna work out. I quit.

358
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:33,000
You can't quit. Hold on.

359
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:39,208
Where did she go?

360
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:41,291
Excuse me.

361
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:04,291
Come on, let's go. Move.

362
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:05,875
Don't forget your positions.

363
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:08,208
Mine's on the left.

364
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:09,291
Yeah, bro.

365
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:11,208
Get ready.

366
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,208
Up next,
we have a very special piece.

367
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:20,500
An artifact recovered from
the wreckage of the Avengers compound.

368
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:25,541
Now you may recall the Ronin decimated
the criminal underworld of the city,

369
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:31,166
almost completely annihilating the status
and power of the head of organized crime.

370
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:35,083
The Ronin brought
a brutal form of justice to his victims,

371
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:39,916
and his identity continues
to remain a mystery to this very day.

372
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:44,666
Now you can own
this one-of-a-kind retractable sword,

373
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,375
and we'll start the bidding at $200,000.

374
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:49,833
Do I hear $200,000? $200,000,

00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:51,750
<i>bidder bidder,</i> do I hear $250,000?

Do I hear $300,000?

377
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:56,500
$300,000, looking for $350,000.

378
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:58,166
What are you doing, you dope?

379
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,750
I'm buying that sword.

380
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:03,208
You don't have 300 grand.

381
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,291
No, but I'll inherit it one day, won't I?

382
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:11,041
-$350,000.
-$350,000, right here in the front.

383
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:14,250
Do we go to $400,000?
Let's go to four. Four, thank you so much.

384
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,625
At $400,000, do I hear $450,000?

385
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:22,708
Moving to two.

386
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:24,125
Okay, everybody ready?

387
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,541
$440,000, do I hear $450,000?

388
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:37,333
$450,000 up front. Looking for $475,000.

389
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:39,333
Come on, ladies and gentlemen.

390
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:42,000
This sword belonged to the infamous Ronin.

391
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:44,541
$475,000.

392
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:46,833
$475,000, <i>bidder bidder,</i>
do I hear $500,000?

393
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:49,291
I've got $475,000 here, it's going once.

394
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:52,500
$475,000 is going twice.

395
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,958
Sold for $475,000.

396
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,708
Up next, we have lot number 3-0-9.

397
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:03,000
The companion piece, the Ronin suit.

398
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:55,333
Help! Please help!

399
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:57,041
Security!

400
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:59,166
We're stuck in here!

401
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:03,041
We've got 90 seconds
to find the watch.

402
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,750
Everything else is secondary.

403
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:05,833
Let's go, bro.

404
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:08,166
-MAN 3: Spread out. Let's go, let's go.

405
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:11,041
Find the watch!

406
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,333
Where is it? Where is it?

407
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:34,250
Come on! We're running out of time!

408
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:37,083
Come on. Let's go.

409
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:44,375
Grab my hand!

410
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,833
I can't see.

411
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:50,083
Do you know who I am?

412
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:01,708
Hello.

413
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:08,333
Quick, hurry!
Everyone get out of here!

414
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:12,500
I see him! I see him, there!

415
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:25,000
Okay.

416
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,583
Come on, Kate.

417
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:37,416
He disappeared!

418
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:39,458
I'm telling you, it was the Ronin!

419
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:42,958
He's here somewhere, bro!
Keep looking!

420
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,041
Oh, shit!

421
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:15,208
He's getting away!

422
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:19,833
Darling!

423
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:23,000
-Where's Kate? She won't answer the phone.
-I don't know.

424
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,875
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

425
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah. I'm fine.

426
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:46,250
-Ronin?

427
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:36,833
The watch. I found it.

428
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:40,125
Hey!

429
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:42,750
Get off me!

430
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:44,833
I'm gonna get you, you dumb dog!

431
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:46,916
-Ow! Aah!

432
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,166
I kill you!

433
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,500
Hey!

434
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:54,875
-KATE: Wait!

00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:02,583
Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

436
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:05,583
-Oh, wait! Wait! No, no, no.

437
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:22,708
Kazi! Kazi!

00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:27,375
Kazi! We go now! Come on!

440
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:30,666
Let's get to the van
and go after her.

441
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:45,166
You were right about the tree, Dad.
It was amazing.

442
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,708
I want one that big.

443
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,458
It wouldn't fit
in our house, dummy.

444
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:50,708
Please, please, please?

445
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:53,375
It's a little late for TV, guys.
I've gotta pack.

446
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,416
Ay, ay, ay.

447
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:59,166
<i>We are following a breaking news story.</i>

448
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,375
<i>A high society gala rocked by an explosion</i>

449
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,333
<i>when it went off at Park Avenue</i>
<i>and 68th Street tonight.</i>

450
00:39:06,416 --> 00:39:08,875
<i>The cause of the explosion</i>
<i>is still under investigation.</i>

451
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:13,708
<i>But witnesses captured cell phone footage</i>
<i>of a masked assailant fleeing the scene.</i>

452
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:16,458
Check it out.

453
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:18,791
A ninja saved a dog.

454
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:21,750
<i>Authorities believe</i>
<i>the assailant could be the Ronin...</i>

455
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:23,333
Isn't that awesome, Dad?

456
00:39:23,416 --> 00:39:26,083
<i>...who terrorized</i>
<i>organized crime in New York and elsewhere.</i>

457
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:42,375
<i>This is the first</i>
<i>potential sighting of the Ronin in years.</i>

458
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,541
Welcome to my apartment.

459
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:50,166
Whoa. Okay, that was, that was crazy.

460
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:53,000
But we're safe. We're safe.

461
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:55,541
Okay, what is going on with Armand?

462
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:58,416
Threatening my mom
and buying black market swords?

463
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,875
Do you think he's connected
to the break-in somehow?

464
00:40:03,916 --> 00:40:06,375
-Food. You want food. Uh, of course. Oh.

465
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:07,541
Uh...

466
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:10,083
Okay, listen. Just hang on.

467
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:12,416
I'm gonna... I'm gonna get you some food.

468
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,500
Uh...

469
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,208
Pizza? You want some pizza?

470
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:17,291
Okay.

471
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,875
Have some. Go on.

472
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:21,583
Good boy. Wow.

473
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,708
You like pizza.

474
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:27,875
I've got to figure out
what's up with Armand.

475
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:32,083
Okay.

476
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:35,875
Do not destroy this apartment.

477
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,083
Monogrammed butterscotch?

478
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,250
Armand?

479
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:19,166
Oh, God!

480
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:23,125
Mr. Duquesne?

481
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,208
I have your dry cleaning,
and I brought dinner.

482
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:58,250
Where do you think you're going?
We only want to talk.

483
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:01,083
Hey,
we got little surprise for you.

484
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:03,083
We've got eyes everywhere.

485
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:05,291
We missed you, Ronin.

486
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,833
We got you now, bro.

487
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:12,625
Why you makin' it so tough on us, bro?

488
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:17,291
Sorry.

489
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:33,875
Oh, come on.

490
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:42,833
Come on!

491
00:44:43,541 --> 00:44:45,125
You're... You're Hawkeye!

492
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:47,583
And who the hell are you?
